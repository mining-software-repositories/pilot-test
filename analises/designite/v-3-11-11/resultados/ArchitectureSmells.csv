v-3-11-11,org.apache.cassandra.metrics,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.cassandra.metrics; org.apache.cassandra.utils.memory; org.apache.cassandra.db
v-3-11-11,org.apache.cassandra.metrics,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.cassandra.metrics; org.apache.cassandra.utils.memory; org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent; org.apache.cassandra.utils
v-3-11-11,org.apache.cassandra.metrics,Cyclic Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating components in the cycle are: org.apache.cassandra.metrics; org.apache.cassandra.utils.memory; org.apache.cassandra.utils.concurrent; org.apache.cassandra.utils; org.apache.cassandra.db
v-3-11-11,org.apache.cassandra.metrics,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): org.apache.cassandra.db.compaction; org.apache.cassandra.io.sstable.metadata; org.apache.cassandra.index
v-3-11-11,org.apache.cassandra.metrics,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [LatencyMetrics]; [BufferPoolMetrics]; [MetricNameFactory; CassandraMetricsRegistry; DefaultNameFactory; ThreadPoolMetricNameFactory; KeyspaceMetrics; KeyspaceMetricNameFactory; ThreadPoolMetrics; TableMetrics; TableMetricNameFactory; AllTableMetricNameFactory]; [SEPMetrics]; [HintsServiceMetrics]; [DroppedMessageMetrics]; [CASClientRequestMetrics]; [ClientRequestMetrics]; [CompactionMetrics]; [ClearableHistogram]; [ViewWriteMetrics]; [ReadRepairMetrics]; [ConnectionMetrics]; [MessagingMetrics]; [ClientMetrics; AuthMetrics]; [CacheMetrics]; [StreamingMetrics]; [GetHistogram]; [TableHistogram]; [TableTimer]; [StorageMetrics]; [MetricMBean]; [AbstractBean]; [JmxGaugeMBean]; [JmxGauge]; [JmxHistogramMBean]; [JmxHistogram]; [JmxCounterMBean]; [JmxCounter]; [JmxMeterMBean]; [JmxMeter]; [JmxTimerMBean]; [JmxTimer]; [MetricName]; [HintedHandoffMetrics]; [DifferencingCounter]; [RestorableMeter; RestorableEWMA]; [DecayingEstimatedHistogramReservoir]; [EstimatedHistogramReservoirSnapshot]; [CacheMissMetrics]; [CQLMetrics]; [CommitLogMetrics]; [MetricValue]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.8
v-3-11-11,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves. Average degree = 16.17.
